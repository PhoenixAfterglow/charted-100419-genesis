# Charted

Charted is an app geared for farmers and ranchers struggling to decipher their livestock and / or crop performance.  With Charted, a farmer / rancher can upload a .CSV file for on-demand field management.

### Prerequisites

If you don't have Visual Studio Code, Node.js and / or Terminal / GitBash installed, you will not be able to run this app.

## Getting Started

Visit the deployed Charted link on Heroku at:

Once in, upload a .CSV file and then click to display your chart.

NOTE:  Since this app has User Authentication and Validation through PassportJS, the User can save their chart(s) since it is securely held within our MySQL database.
